Issue relates to add-in card:
Model: SuperMicro AOC-SLG3-2M2

Issue description:
I purchased an AOC-SLG3-2M2 for this server so that nvme drives could be added as the boot and OS drives. The motherboard (X10DRU-i+) supports pci-e bifurcation and is listed on the add-in card's "Validated Platforms" list. After installation of the card I applied the correct BIOS settings but the card would not show as a boot device.

Resolution:
SuperMicro states that the add-in card's "validated platforms" list means nothing more than "the card works", not that all features are available, which in this case is the feature of booting from the device.
I was able to add nvme drivers to the latest BIOS. Afterwards I was able to boot from the nvme drives on the add-in card.

[additional technical details pending]
